# Daily EMR Modernization & Investment Roadmap

_Last updated: October 19, 2025_

## 1. Product Vision & Guiding Principles

- **Kenya-first, Africa-ready**: Preserve localization for SHA/SHIF while designing extensible modules for other NHIF-style schemes across East Africa.
- **Care-team workflow excellence**: Every surface should shave minutes off repetitive clinical, billing, and reporting tasks.
- **Evidence-driven operations**: Embed analytics into daily routines, automating insights rather than producing static dashboards.
- **Enterprise-grade trust**: Deliver bank-level security, auditability, and uptime to earn institutional adoption.

These principles underpin every initiative below.

## 2. Patient & Clinician Experience

| Initiative | Outcome | Investment Themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Responsive design system** | Pixel-perfect UI across tablet carts, nurse stations, and mobile rounds. | Commission a UX design partner to build a Figma library + Storybook implementation in Tailwind/React Aria. |
| **Offline-first charting** | Maintain visit continuity during network dropouts. | Service worker powered data sync, IndexedDB cache, background replication queues, optimistic updates with CRDT conflict resolution. |
| **Clinical pathways engine** | Guided workflows for chronic disease management (e.g., HIV, hypertension). | Author tooling for configurable care plans, templated order sets, dynamic triage cues, clinician KPI tracking. |
| **Embedded telehealth** | Remote consults & specialist reviews. | Integrate WebRTC provider (Daily.co or Vonage), scheduling, clinical note templates, secure recordings. |

## 3. Revenue Cycle & Administration

- **SHA/SHIF smart claims**: Rule engine that validates tariffs, attachments, and benefit limits before submission. Automate XML/JSON packing and reconciliation, with sandbox testers.
- **Inventory & pharmacy**: Real-time stock ledger with GS1-compatible barcoding, purchase order flows, and expiry alerts.
- **Facility ops hub**: Executive dashboards for bed occupancy, average wait times, consumables burn, and staffing compliance.
- **Integrations marketplace**: Native connectors for MPesa Till/Paybill, QuickBooks Online, DHIS2 (daily, weekly exports), and biometric registration devices.

## 4. Data Platform & Intelligence

1. **Operational data store (ODS)**: Consolidate transactional data into a CDC-enabled Postgres replica; use Debezium or Prisma Pulse for change streams.
2. **Analytics warehouse**: dbt + BigQuery/Snowflake modeling canonical dimensions (patient, encounter, procedure, facility).
3. **Metrics layer**: Looker Semantic Layer or Lightdash on top of dbt for governed KPIs.
4. **AI Copilot for clinical notes**: Deploy domain-tuned LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT-4o) with prompt guardrails to summarize visits, suggest ICD-10 codes, highlight missing vitals.
5. **Anomaly detection**: Use Prophet or Kats for time-series forecasting on admissions, claims denials, and lab turnaround.

## 5. Platform & Architecture Enhancements

- **Domain-driven monorepo**: Migrate to Turborepo with separate packages for `app`, `shared-ui`, `services`, and `infrastructure`.
- **Next.js server actions**: Replace ad-hoc API routes with structured server actions + React Query for predictable caching.
- **Event-driven backend**: Introduce a NestJS (or Fastify) microservice layer with Kafka/NATS for asynchronous processing (claims, notifications, analytics ingestion).
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules targeting AWS (EKS, RDS, MSK) or GCP (GKE, Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub). Enforce GitOps via ArgoCD or Flux.
- **Observability stack**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation, Grafana Loki logs, Tempo traces, Prometheus metrics, and SLO dashboards with alerting on PagerDuty.

## 6. Security, Privacy & Compliance

| Pillar | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Data protection** | Row-level encryption for PIIs, envelope encryption using AWS KMS, strict Prisma middleware for multi-tenant scoping. |
| **Identity & access management** | Integrate Keycloak or Auth0 for SSO (MOH smart cards, staff badges) with role-based and attribute-based access control. |
| **Audit & compliance** | Immutable audit logs via Append-Only Ledger (AWS QLDB or PostgreSQL logical decoding). Map to Kenya Data Protection Act, GDPR, HIPAA controls. |
| **Vulnerability management** | Automated dependency scanning (Snyk), container image scanning, quarterly penetration testing with certified partners. |
| **Business continuity** | Multi-region read replicas, 15-minute RPO / 1-hour RTO disaster recovery drills, chaos engineering playbooks. |

## 7. Delivery, QA & Change Management

1. **Design ops**: Figma tokens synchronized with Tailwind config, visual regression testing in Chromatic.
2. **Quality engineering**: Cypress component + end-to-end suites, Playwright for cross-browser compliance, Pact contract tests for APIs.
3. **Release governance**: Trunk-based development with feature flags (LaunchDarkly), automated canary deploys, progressive rollouts.
4. **Customer enablement**: In-app guided tours (Appcues), knowledge base, blended virtual training, quarterly retros with facility leadership.
5. **Regulatory readiness**: Maintain IEC 62304 documentation, ISO 13485-ready QMS templates, audit trails for product changes.

## 8. Talent & Partnerships

- **Core team expansion**: Staff engineering lead (healthcare SaaS background), product design lead, security engineer, data platform lead, implementation manager.
- **Advisory board**: Clinicians, health economists, regulatory experts from Kenya MOH and NHIF.
- **Vendor relationships**: Cloud provider enterprise support, payment switch partners, hardware vendors for biometric scanners.
- **Academic collaborations**: Pilot predictive models with local universities and research institutes.

## 9. Phased Investment Timeline (18 Months)

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 0 – Foundation** | Month 0-2 | Secure infra, design system | Terraform + CI/CD hardening, design tokens, Storybook prototype, security threat model. |
| **Phase 1 – Workflow Excellence** | Month 3-6 | Clinician journey, offline support | Offline-first visit flow, pharmacy & inventory MVP, SHA/SHIF claims validation engine. |
| **Phase 2 – Intelligence Layer** | Month 7-11 | Analytics, AI assistance | dbt warehouse, operational dashboards, AI clinical summary pilot, anomaly alerts. |
| **Phase 3 – Scale & Compliance** | Month 12-18 | Multi-facility rollout | Multi-tenant sharding, role-based access with audit trails, DR exercises, onboarding 5-10 flagship facilities. |

## 10. Budget Envelope (Rough Order of Magnitude)

| Workstream | Estimated Range (USD) |
| --- | --- |
| Product & Design system | $120k – $180k |
| Core engineering (offline, claims, integrations) | $400k – $650k |
| Data & AI platform | $150k – $250k |
| Security & compliance | $80k – $150k |
| DevOps & Infrastructure | $140k – $220k |
| Change management & training | $60k – $90k |
| **Total (18 months)** | **$950k – $1.54M** |

> Figures assume a blended team across Nairobi and remote senior specialists. Costs exclude third-party licensing (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Auth0, analytics vendors).

## 11. Immediate Next Steps (Next 30 Days)

1. Commission design discovery sprint → deliver Figma prototype + component inventory.
2. Stand up staging infrastructure (Terraform to AWS/GCP) with observability baseline.
3. Kick off SHA/SHIF claims product requirements with regulatory advisors.
4. Recruit/contract core leadership roles (staff engineer, design lead, security lead).
5. Formalize data governance charter and privacy impact assessment.
